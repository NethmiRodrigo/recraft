## What we are building
 
Everyday, hundreds of waste materials are piling up in Sri Lankan households. Some burn them (causing major environmental damage) and some leave them as it is. But this issue can be resolved with the collaboration of waste producers and recyclers. Also, there are many individuals who are willing to reuse the items used by others, if it's in reasonable condition. We are building a platform to bring this 3 seperated parties together, enabling a buy and sell method of waste items. Good for the environment and products gets resused; its win, win!  

## How we built it

**[Initial Update - 22nd of October]**
Honouring the cultural practices, our first task was to create a WhatsApp group. After dividing our work individually, we designed the system architectureadn the database. Used firebase to design the database. We will be finishing the design language conflicts and starting bulding the UI tommorow. All agreed to choose the 80's retro theme as our design language.  

**[Update 2 - 23rd of October]**
After getting some inspiration from (rare to find) retro themes, we finished the UI of user login and new user registration pages. Then configured them using node js. Also added firebase authentication for user login. We will be finalising the landing page tommorrow.   

**[Update 3 - 24th of October]**
Desgined the landing page UI components such as the navigation menu, footer, posts for latest post updates. As we agreed before, partitioned the landing page into three sections. Center section serves as a news feed, showing the advertisments posted by users about the reusable and recycable items in their households, and advertisments posted by recylcing agents about collecting dates and times of goods.
